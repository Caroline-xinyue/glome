This is GlomeView, a graphical frontend to Glome, my raytracer.  Originally, Glome was a monolithic program, but I have now moved most of the internals to a couple of libraries, GlomeVec and GlomeTrace.

GlomeView requires HOpenGL.

This was one of the first things I wrote in Haskell.  As such, it has a few rough edges.
